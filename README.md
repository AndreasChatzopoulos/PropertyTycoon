# Property Tycoon

Welcome to Property Tycoon!

This is the term project for Team 23 created for the 2025 Winter semester Software Engineering module at the University of Sussex. Please note that all images and audio are royalty free. Images were taken from Google and all sound effects are taken on Pixabay.

## Configuration

Please make sure you have python3 installed. From the root directory of the project, run "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install the necessary dependencies.

## Usage

Once the requrements are installed, please run main.py in the root directory. The game UI will then pop up as a pygame window, and you can begin playing the game. Be sure to have the volume on for the full game experience.

Thank you for playing our game! We worked hard on it and hope you'll enjoy playing it as much as we enjoyed making it.
